<p><strong>SASUKE UCHIHA :</strong>Sasuke belongs to the Uchiha clan, a notorious ninja family, and one of the most powerful, allied with Konohagakure (English: "Hidden Leaf Village"). Most of its members were massacred by Sasuke's older brother, Itachi Uchiha, before the series began, leaving Sasuke one of the few living. Despite becoming empathetic toward his teammates Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno, Sasuke's feelings of powerlessness force him to abandon his friends and his home in his quest to become stronger, and to find Orochimaru.

<h2>ABOUT TEAM 7</h2>
<p><strong>TEAM 7</strong>was a Konohagakure team formed under the leadership of Kakashi Hatake. Two-and-a-half years after Sasuke Uchiha left the village, Kakashi filled out paperwork to form Team Kakashi, with his former pupils Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno now being treated as equals alongside their teacher. Following Yamato and Sai joining the team, the group went by Team Yamato during the former's leadership.</p>

<p><strong>MADARA UCHIHA :</strong> appears for the first time in "Part II" of the manga and the Shippuden anime adaptation, as a major antagonist. He, along with its first Hokage Hashirama Senju, is one of the co-founders of Konohagakure village from the ninja world. Their power conflict over how to run the village, as well as the long-term feud between clans, leads to Madara's death. However, it is revealed later that Madara had used a man named Obito Uchiha as his agent. He transplants his Rinnegan  eye power into a child named Nagato, a member of the terrorist organization Akatsuki, to be preserved for his eventual revival years later. During most of the series, Obito uses Madara's name until a criminal named Kabuto Yakushi reanimates the real Madara who becomes one of the primary antagonists alongside Obito Uchiha during the Fourth Great Shinobi World War storyline<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madara_Uchiha"><button>more</button></a> </p>

<p><strong>OBITO UCHIHA</strong> is first introduced in a "Kakashi Chronicle" side story as a young ninja who sacrifices himself to save his friends (Kakashi Hatake and Rin Nohara, led by Minato Namikaze) from an adversary group of ninjas. Although he was believed to have died in the 3rd Great Ninja War, Obito is later revealed as the real leader of the terrorist organization known as the Akatsuki, mainly acting behind the scenes for a majority of the group's tenure. He uses the alias of his benefactor, Madara Uchiha, and conceals his true identity with masks as one of the main antagonists of the series' second half.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obito_Uchiha"><button>more</button></a> </p>

<p><strong>NAGATO</strong>is the figurehead leader of the Akatsuki who wishes to capture the tailed beasts sealed into various people around the shinobi world. After acquiring and sealing most of the beasts within a Gedo statue, Nagato's advisor advises him to capture the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox sealed inside the series' protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki (whom he turns out to be related to). Before leaving to capture Naruto, Nagato engages in a mortal battle with his former mentor, Jiraiya. His past as a war orphan, and his loss of his best friend are explored. Due to his traumatic experiences, which stemmed from human conflict, Nagato aims to create a new world, free from the chaos of war. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagato_(Naruto)"><button>more</button></a> </p>

<p><strong>GAARA</strong>Gaara is a shinobi affiliated with Sunagakure and is the son of Sunagakure's leader, the Fourth Kazekage. He was born as a demon's host as part of his father's intention to have a weapon to restore their village. However, a combination of being ostracized by the Sunagakure villagers, his early inability to control the Tailed Beast, and the notion that his deceased mother called him her curse on the village caused Gaara to become a ruthless killer who believes his own purpose is to kill his enemies. Only after meeting Naruto Uzumaki does Gaara earn a change of perspective, as he eventually becomes Sunagakure's Fifth Kazekaga and gains acceptance by his people.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaara"><button>more</button></a></p>
